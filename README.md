# 🇧🇬 🇪🇺 Change calculator to help people during Bulgaria's dual currency period in the transition to the EURO

A simple calculator to help Bulgarians during the Euro transition period. When you pay in Leva but receive change in Euro, this app tells you exactly how much you should get back.

**Built with the help of AI to solve a real problem for real people.**

## Why?

From January 1, 2026, Bulgaria uses the Euro. During the transition:

- You can **pay** in both € and leva
- You get **change only in Euro**

This creates confusion: _"I paid 20 leva for an 8€ coffee... how much Euro change?"_

## Usage

1. Enter the **price** (defaults to €, tap to switch to leva)
2. Enter what you **paid** (defaults to leva, tap to switch to €)
3. See your **change** in both currencies

**Fixed rate:** €1 = 1.95583 leva

## Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
